          Sound frequency therapy, or vibrational therapy, uses specific sound
          waves to support physical, emotional, and energetic healing. It’s
          based on the idea that each cell and organ has its own natural
          frequency, and illness may result from disruptions in these
          vibrations. By applying targeted frequencies, balance and wellness may
          be restored. A clinical form of this is ultrasound therapy, which uses
          high-frequency sound waves (1–3 MHz) to penetrate deep into tissues.
          It enhances blood flow, reduces inflammation, and encourages cellular
          repair. Unlike audible sound therapies, ultrasound is inaudible and
          delivered through a transducer directly to the affected area.

        <h1>Auric  <br /><span>Resonance</span></h1>
        <p>
          Auric Resonance vibrates at ~8.8 Hz, a subtle frequency just above the Earth’s natural Schumann Resonance. Tuning into it brings the human energy field—commonly called the aura—into a state of harmony, enhancing emotional clarity, intuition, and spiritual awareness. Mystics, empaths, and energy healers use ARF to center themselves and others, especially during deep meditation or energetic cleansing. In sacred sanctuaries, ARF-emitting stones hum beneath the floor, creating fields of peace and protection. Exposure over time is said to unlock latent psychic sensitivity. In science, it's linked to alpha/theta brainwave states and grounding techniques that restore internal balance.

        <h1> Lumen <br /><span>Radiation</span></h1>
        <p>
          Lumen Radiation pulses in the infrared spectrum, between 300–400 THz, just below visible red light. Its unique signature interacts with cellular processes, accelerating DNA repair and tissue regeneration. Commonly found in advanced medical pods or surgical light baths, it's valued for non-invasive healing. However, extended exposure causes subjective time dilation—minutes may feel like hours to the patient. Legends tell of rogue scientists using concentrated Lumen to reverse aging or extend consciousness into a suspended state. Though rooted in real-world red light therapy and photobiomodulation, in fiction, Lumen becomes a gateway to both miraculous recovery and temporal distortion.

        <h1>Echo <br /><span>Pulse Waves</span></h1>
        <p>
          Echo Pulse Waves resonate with the molecular structure of water, aligning with frequencies that influence hydration and cellular coherence. First discovered deep within aquamarine caverns, they’re used by healers to "tune" the body's internal water, promoting faster healing and emotional fluidity. The waves carry data patterns—memories, even languages—through liquid, enabling communication with aquatic species and the recovery of deep-buried trauma. Echo chambers are sacred to the Waterbound, who meditate inside submerged domes lined with sound-activated crystals. Based on ideas like Masaru Emoto’s water memory theory and therapeutic ultrasound, Echo Waves merge science with poetic resonance.

        <h1>Celestium <br /><span>Rays</span></h1>
        <p>
          Celestium Rays are exotic cosmic emissions only found near ancient meteorite sites or during rare celestial alignments. These radiant waves interact directly with neural plasticity, enhancing dreams, memory recall, and even past-life access. Exposure stimulates deep visionary states, allowing dreamwalkers to navigate consciousness across space and time. Often used in astral navigation or higher-dimensional research, Celestium Rays are considered sacred and dangerous. Unauthorized contact can lead to permanent detachment from the present mind. Drawing parallels to gamma radiation, DMT experiences, and meditation-induced altered states, Celestium is the light of forgotten stars—mysterious, transcendent, and transformative.

        <h1>Vibralux <br /><span>Fields</span></h1>
        <p>
          Vibralux Fields are scalar torsion energies that form protective, emotion-neutral zones. Used in sanctuaries, meditation pods, or worn as subtle tech shields, they block psychic interference, trauma echoes, and emotional overload. Originating from blackstone quarries deep beneath ancient monastic fortresses, Vibralux energy was first discovered during the Time of Screams, when silence became sacred. Today, empathic warriors use it to maintain composure in chaotic environments. Though controversial in scientific circles, Vibralux is inspired by theories of scalar fields and EMF shielding. Fictionally, it’s peace made tangible—a silent hum that keeps the soul from fracturing under the weight of the world.
